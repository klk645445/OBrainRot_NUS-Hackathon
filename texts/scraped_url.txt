Title: How many more fatal accidents do we need before we punish reckless drivers proactively?
Description: I believe that these people should be permanently banned from driving without giving them a chance to return to the wheel.

1. Drunk Drivers - If there’s a first time, there will be more times. Driving under the influence shows a reckless disregard for safety that rarely stops at one offense without serious consequences.

2. Excessive Speeders (20+ km/h over the limit) - Similarly, this wouldn’t be their last time, and they’ll just get bolder each time they get off scot-free. Habitual speeding at this level suggests they prioritize thrill or impatience over others’ lives.

3. Repeat Red-Light Runners - People caught multiple times blowing through red lights aren’t just unlucky—they’re willfully ignoring basic rules. It’s a pattern that endangers everyone at intersections.

4. Road Rage Offenders - Drivers who’ve escalated aggression into physical altercations or intentional ramming don’t belong on the road. That level of volatility turns a car into a weapon.

5. License Dodgers - People caught driving without a valid license, especially after prior suspensions, clearly don’t respect the system. Why give them more chances to prove it?

6. Hit-and-Run Perpetrators - Fleeing an accident, particularly with injuries, marks someone who’d rather save themselves than face responsibility. They’ve already checked out of accountability.
